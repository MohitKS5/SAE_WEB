  				<h2>SAE International</h2>
  				<p>SAE International, founded in 1905, is a global association of more than 1,38,000 engineers and related technical experts dedicated to advancing mobility technology for use in everyday life. SAE India is an affiliate society of SAE International registered in India as a national non-profit engineering and scientific society dedicated to advancement of mobile industry in India.</p>

  				<h2>Formula SAE</h2>
  				<p>Formula SAE is an international student design competition sponsored by the Society of Automotive Engineers. The program simulates real-world engineering design projects and related challenges with the goal of developing and building a small Formula-style race car. Teams from countries around the world compete in static and dynamic events. </p>
  				<p style="margin-top:10px;">The concept behind Formula SAE is that a fictional manufacturing company has contracted a student design team to develop a small Formula-Style Race Car. The Prototype Race Car is to be evaluated for its potential as a production item. The target marketing group for the race car is the non-professional weekend autocross racer. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based on a series of rules, whose purpose is both ensuring on-track safety (the cars are driven by the students themselves) and promoting clever problem solving.</p>
  				<h3>FSAE Rules & Regulations</h3>
  				<p>Teams taking part in Formula SAE are judged in a series of static and dynamic events. Static events include things like business presentation engineering design and cost and sustainability.The teams who pass the static events are then allowed to participate in the dynamic events where they are scored based on how well their vehicle performs in various tasks. Therefore, Formula SAE encompasses all aspects of a business including research, design, manufacturing, testing, developing, marketing, management, and fund raising.</p>

  				<h2>BAJA SAE</h2>
  				<p>Baja SAE is another design competition held under the banner of SAE International. It encourages teams of students from universities all over the world to design and build small off-road vehicles adhering strictly to rules. The vehicle must be safe, easily transported, easily maintained and fun to drive.It should be able to traverse rough terrain without damage. It is held in US, India, Brazil, South Africa and Korea.

  				<h2>Effi-Cycle</h2>
  				<p>Efficycle is an intercollegiate design competition for undergraduate and graduate
students where teams have to design and fabricate an energy efficient entirely human
powered three-wheeled vehicle. The vehicle must be aerodynamic, highly engineered
and ergonomically designed. The design should be commercially viable as a product and
should be attractive to the consumers because of its visual appearance, performance,
reliability and ease of operation. </p><br>
<p>The Competition includes designing, validating and fabricating a three wheeled vehicle
driven by two drivers. The vehicle would be capable to be driven simultaneously as well
as alternatively by two drivers. The vehicle would be evaluated for its design and
performance and the teams compete against each other. The cumulative scores of all
the events would decide the overall ranking of the teams in the event. </p>

    <h2>Our Cars</h2>

      <h3>F13</h3>
          <p align="justify">IITK motorsports started its first season of Formula SAE with emphasis being laid on designing a car which is simple yet efficient. Drivability, reliability and cost effectiveness were the specific areas focused upon. A modular design based approach was followed to minimize the pre-manufacturing period and make the car as personalized as possible while following the basic design goals. Manufacturability on large scale was a crucial factor governing the design procedure. Design strategy was also affected immensely by the proposed buyer and the car was designed to minimize the post purchase maintenance of the car. It was ensured that the car was aesthetically sound as well, to attract its customers.
Emphasis was laid on maximizing the learning curve and working things out from the very basic principles. Various tests were performed for different subsystems of the car so as to enhance the final performance. Documentation of the whole design process was also done to make sure all the data was available for any future reference. Thus, a data driven design process focused on the basic principles of designing resulted in the building of an efficacious car. The grand ancestor of all #091!

</p>


<h3>B15</h3>
  <p align="justify">The second car of the first season was also our first off-road vehicle which was agile and lightweight. Our design objective was to build light weight car that could perform in harsh conditions. Since it was our first car our, one of our objectives was to successfully complete all the dynamic events without major component failure and yet delivering the maximum performance. The vehicle dynamics associated with the car were highly tunable which gave us the freedom to juice the best out of our car. Will always be loved #21!
  </p>

  <h3>F16</h3>
  <p align="justify">IITK Motorsports is competing in FS India for the first time in 2016 and this is our second participation in FS events. Weight reduction, manufacturability and reliability were the key design goals. Ergonomics and compact packaging were the major areas of improvement this year. A major step to reduce weight was to include composite materials. In the development of the vehicle, a strong focus was placed on the car’s suspension geometry, powertrain and ergonomics to make the vehicle more driver friendly for a better performance.
The design goals for this car were decreasing car’s weight by 25% - 60kg (from 240Kgs), manufacturing of the vehicle is simple and cost-effective and the vehicle must complete all dynamic events at Formula SAE INDIA. Smokin’em all #90!
</p>

<h3>B16</h3>
<p align="justify">This was our second off road vehicle which was built to compete in the competition BSI 2016. The design objectives were to build a robust, light weight and efficient vehicle that could endure the brutality of off road tracks. We designed and fabricated our gear box which was the central jewel in our masterpiece. It weighed 68% less than that used in the previous season. We also experimented with composites which enabled us to build ultra-light components such as carbon fiber reinforced camber links and glass fiber body panels. The chassis was completely redesigned after performing extensive simulations on ANSYS and thus was built a chassis of 26.5 kilograms, 6 kilograms less than the previous version. The wheel assembly was compact and used one of a kind knuckle which was extremely light weight. All in all, our car had a visibly clean and compact packaging of all the components which ultimately ensured lower center of gravity, weight reduction and thus better maneuverability and performance. The final weight of the car was 161 kilograms which was a reduction of 20% from the previous car. Viva La #92!

  <h2>Our Present Goals</h2>
  <p align="justify">We are competing in Supra’16 which is a college based competition held under the banner of SAE India. We will be using F16 which is presently the lightest FSAE car in the country. Simultaneously, we are designing the FSAE car for the next season using which we will be competing in Formula Student India 2017 and Supra’17.
